# DietitianWebsite
A dynamic website developed for a dietitian. Users may interact with the website by inputting his/her body information so as to calculate their Body Mass Index. Getting the value of the BMI user may see his/her tailor-made diet table by clicking a button.

The table pops up just below the calculation part. Once you click anywhere on the page it disappears.

Users find Dietitian's background and profile in the following part.

After the profile section, diet programs for specific purposes show up.
By clicking on the image one may see the details of the clicked diet program.

Below diet programs, reviews of the previous clients come in as a carousel.

At last, contacts of the dietitian were provided in the footer
